                    <br/>
                    <p>At HLO, we’re big on trust and safety. These Community Guidelines help ensure that every HH (Home Healthcare) Service is a delightful, safe and trusted experience for both our Clients and Caregivers. While we know that these Guidelines may not cover every single HH (Home Healthcare) Service and situation you may encounter, we expect all Caregivers and Clients to act with professionalism and in good character to maintain a positive experience for all.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Community Guidelines for Caregivers</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <p>HLO is your platform to grow your business. To be successful, here are five simple things you can do:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Represent yourself accurately: To be successful on HLO, set accurate criteria for the HH Services you want to perform, including your availability, hourly rate, work area, and HH Service categories. Please keep this information up-to-date to ensure that you receive the most appropriate HH Service invitations.</li>
                        <li>Set clear expectations with your Clients: Surprises are not a good thing when it comes to HH Servicing, so please ensure that nothing unexpected happens while you’re working on a HH Service. Be sure to set clear expectations about HH Service timing, out-of-pocket expenses and any other details that are relevant to completing the HH Service.</li>
                        <li>Respond quickly to your Client: HH Service invitations and communications with your Client are time sensitive. Respond quickly and actively manage all Client communications via the chat feature in the app to create great Client experiences.</li>
                        <li>Be reliable: This one’s simple - please do what you say you'll do. Show up on time (or early) and stay until the job is done. It is critical that you complete all the HH Services that you take on and deliver the best service possible.</li>
                        <li>Treat HLO like your business: As you know, HLO is a platform to grow your own business. Delivering great experiences will result in even more work for you. Ask yourself what will make this Client want to hire you again and deliver an experience that matches those expectations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The following sections provide more detail on what we expect from you as a Caregiver. Please be aware that violation of these guidelines may result in reduced access to HH Service opportunities or outright removal from the HLO Community.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>The 3 pillars of Caregiver Success are:</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Responsiveness</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Responsiveness is critical to your success as a Caregiver. We set expectations with our Clients that Caregivers will respond to a HH Service invitation within 30 minutes, so reply as promptly as possible.</li>
                        <li>If you are on a HH Service and you receive an invitation, let your current Client know that you will be responding to the invitation and then return immediately to the current HH Service.</li>
                        <li>Do not leave a Client waiting for your reply to a message in the chat thread. A prompt and clear reply is important to Client satisfaction. Please closely manage chat threads for all HH Services you have been invited to.</li>
                        <li>HH Service invitations need to be accepted and scheduled or forfeited as quickly as possible. Failure to take the appropriate action on a HH Service invitation can result in a policies violation or removal from the HLO Community.</li>
                        <li>Your Caregiver account may be paused if we notice a significant period of inactivity (no closed or accepted HH Services over 90 days). If this happens, please visit HealthyLovedOnes.com/orientations to see any upcoming orientation sessions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Professionalism</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HLO is a Community for professionals looking to create positive Client experiences. Any unprofessional behavior impacts the entire Community and will not be tolerated.</li>
                        <li>Some tips to demonstrate professionalism: Use your real name and a recent professional photo that includes your face on your profile.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>High-Quality Work</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only accept HH Services that you have the time, qualifications and tools to complete. Understand the location of the HH Service, the expectations of the Client and complete your HH Service in a manner consistent with these expectations.</li>
                        <li>When scheduling HH Services, be sure to leave enough time between HH Services for traveling, traffic or any other issues that may arise.</li>
                        <li>Don’t accept HH Services that you feel ill-equipped to handle and avoid performing low-quality work on a HH Service.</li>
                        <li>Perform all HH Services yourself. You may not outsource your HH Service to a third party, company or competitor under any circumstance.</li>
                        <li>If you require additional help on a HH Service, it is critical that the person also be an approved Caregiver. This is for your and the Client's safety. If anything goes wrong on a HH Service, whether or not it was associated with the actions of someone who is not an approved Caregiver, they (and you) may not covered by the HLO $1M Insurance Guarantee.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>The Nitty-gritty on HH Servicing Procedures</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Ok, so what do the pillars of Caregiver success look like in action? This section outlines how you should conduct your business on the HLO platform.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Accepting invitations</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We provide tools for you to tell us the types of HH Services you are willing to do, at what times, in what areas and at what hourly rate. We expect you to accept HH Service invitations that fall within the boundaries that you’ve set.</li>
                        <li>Clients invest time and effort in selecting a specific Caregiver which is why accepting every HH Service invitation you receive is very important. A Client specifically asked to work with you.</li>
                        <li>A low invitation acceptance rate is grounds for reduced access to HH Service opportunities or removal from the HLO Community.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Forfeiting</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forfeiting a HH Service can quickly turn a great opportunity into a negative Client experience. HH Service forfeiting should be a last resort and only reserved for extenuating circumstances.</li>
                        <li>Some legitimate reasons for forfeiting a HH Service include: believing you cannot deliver a high-quality experience for the Client, not having the proper tools for the HH Service, or feelingunsafe about a HH Service. Scheduling conflicts are not considered a legitimate reason for forfeiting a HH Service given the schedule management tools we provided.</li>
                        <li>Frequent forfeiting may result in reduced access to HH Service opportunities, or outright removal from, the HLO Community.</li>
                        <li>If a Client cancels a HH Service within 12 hours of the scheduled time, you may be eligible for 1 hour of payment. Please email cancel@healthylovedones.com for more information regarding this policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Available HH Services</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Available HH Services are a great way to pick up HH Services quickly, fill openings in your schedule and build Client relationships.</li>
                        <li>Hourly rates on an Available HH Service are non-negotiable, so only accept an Available HH Service if you are prepared to perform the HH Service for the stated rate and if you have enough information about the HH Service from the HH Service description. Attempts to renegotiate the hourly rate on an Available HH Service is grounds for reduced access to HH Service opportunities or removal from the HLO Community.</li>
                        <li>Acceptance is a commitment to perform the HH Service:</li>
                        <li>Only accept Available HH Services if you feel confident that you will complete the HH Service.</li>
                        <li>If the HH Service details do not include enough information to provide you this confidence, do not accept the HH Service.</li>
                        <li>Do not accept an Available HH Service that you are unsure of the time, date and/or location. If you pick up an Available HH Service that you cannot complete due to these reasons, it may be grounds for immediate removal from the community.</li>
                        <li>Do not impose hourly minimums, travel time or travel expenses on the Client when you accept an Available HH Service.</li>
                    </ul>
