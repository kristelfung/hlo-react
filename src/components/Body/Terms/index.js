                    <br/>
                    <span>1.1</span><p className="indented">The Company provides the Service by way of providing an online platform which enables the connection between Clients and Caregivers. “Clients” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain home healthcare services (“HH Services”) from Caregivers and are therefore clients of Caregivers, and “Caregivers” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform HH Services for Clients. Clients and Caregivers together are hereinafter referred to as “Users”.</p>

The Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of HH Services requested and provided by Users identified through the Service whether in public private, or offline interactions.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Caregivers must present valid HKID or Passport. If Passport we will check if they have the correct working visas and paperwork.</li>
                        <li>Caregivers that work with children are required to get a Sexual Conviction Record Check (SCRC) from the Police HQ in Wanchai, 14F, 1 Albertson Road. HLO will issue them a letter which they must bring and include with their application. The cost is HKD115.00 and will take 7 days to get the results.</li>
                        <li>Caregivers that want a No Criminal Conviction record can apply for one through the relevant Consulate / Immigration Authority / Government Authority.

If the Company decides to introduce such service fee, the Company shall inform the Users accordingly by way of announcement in the Site (or through the Company’s mobile application) and allow its Users to terminate their use of the Service at their option. You agree that the announcements made by the Company in the Site or through the Company’s mobile application shall constitute valid and sufficient notice to you in respect of the subject matter thereof and your continued use of the Service following such announcement shall, despite of your actual awareness of the terms of the announcement, constitute your irrevocable acceptance to the service fee as announced by the Company.</p>

Vouchers are an offer (subject to the terms of the voucher) by the Company to reduce the amount a Client has to pay in relation to a HH Service Payment and/or the Company’s fee. Vouchers will not affect the amount of the HH Service Payment a Caregiver ultimately receives.

                    <br/>
                    <span>5.5</span><p className="indented">No credit card, credit line, overdraft protection, or deposit account is associated with your Gift Card. You cannot “reload” (i.e., you cannot add value/balance to your Gift Card at this time). If a Gift Card holder's purchase exceeds the amount of that Gift Card's balance, the Gift Card holder must pay the difference by another means. Unused Gift Card balances are not transferable. The Company reserves the right to correct the balance of a Gift Card if the Company believes that a billing error has occurred. The Company disclaims all liability for any such billing errors. Gift Cards and their use are subject to these Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy and the Community Guidelines and use of a Gift Card constitutes acceptance hereof.</p>
